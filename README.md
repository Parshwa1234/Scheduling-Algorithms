Hello! 
This repository consists of Group Assignment implemented by Parshwa Jain (me) and my partner Dhruvish Mehta.

This project is basically implementing Scheduling Algorithms in C++ by taking input from input.txt and giving ouput in output.txt file.
It requires basic C++ setup of vscode and input and output files to execute efficently...

Basically We have implemented switch case for 1)First come first serve 2)Shortest Job first 3)Shortest Remaining time first 4) Round Robin Schedular 5) Priority Nom Preemptive 6) Priority Preemtive algorithms.

We calculated completion time based on algorithms implemented in functions created for each and TAT=CT-AT and WT=TAT-BT. Then we have printed Gantt chart for scheduling algorithm and also table of AT,BT,CT,TAT,WT for visulization of algorithm in output.txt file and displayed average waiting and turn around time for visulazing efficiency of algorithm...

Hope you liked Approach and structured code including features like File handling, Object handling, Priority queue, Queue, Vector handling, Algorithms and Logics.
